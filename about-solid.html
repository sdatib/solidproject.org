            <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                <p>Solid is an open standard for structuring data, digital identities, and applications on the Web.</p>
                <p>Solid aims to support the creation of the Web as Sir Tim Berners-Lee originally envisioned it when he
                    invented the Web at CERN in 1989. Tim sometimes refers to Solid as “the web - take 3" — or Web3.0 —
                    because Solid integrates a new layer of standards into the Web we already have. The goal of Solid is
                    for people to have more agency over their data.</p>

                <section id="solid" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#solid">
                    <h2 property="schema:name">Solid</h2>
                    <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                        <img src="image/store-anything-tour.svg" alt="store-anything-tour" width="100%" />
                        <p>Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data
                            stores
                            called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for your data.</p>
                        <p>Entities control access to the data in their Pod. Entities decide what data to share and with
                            whom
                            (be those individuals, organizations, applications, etc.), and can revoke access at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p>To store and access data in a Pod, Solid-enabled applications use standard, open, and
                            interoperable
                            data formats and protocols.</p>

                            <h3 property="schema:name">Data</h3>

                                <p>Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid Pod — from structured data to files that
                                    one might
                                    store in a Google Drive or Dropbox folder.</p>
                                <p>What makes Solid special is the ability to store data in a way that promotes
                                    interoperability.
                                    Specifically, Solid supports storing Linked Data. Structuring data as Linked Data
                                    means that
                                    different applications can work with the same data.</p>

                                <p>All data in a Solid Pod is stored and accessed using standard, open, and
                                    interoperable data
                                    formats and protocols. Solid uses a common, shared way of describing things and
                                    their
                                    relationships to one another that different applications can understand. This gives
                                    Solid the
                                    unique ability to allow different applications to work with the same data.</p>

                                <p>With Solid's Authentication and Authorization systems, one can determine which people
                                    and
                                    applications can access their data. Entities can grant or revoke access to any slice
                                    of
                                    their data as needed. Consequently, entities can do more with their data, because
                                    the
                                    applications they decide to use can be granted access to a wider and more diverse
                                    set of
                                    information.</p>
                                <p>And just as one can share their data with others, others can also share their data in
                                    return.
                                    This creates rich and collaborative experiences across a combination of both
                                    personal and
                                    shared data.</p>

                        <p>A Solid Server hosts one or more Solid Pods. Pods are where you store your data:
                            Each Pod is fully controlled by the Pod owner (i.e., you).
                            And each Pod’s data and access rules are fully distinct from those of other Pods.</p>
                        <p>People can get a Pod from a Pod Provider, or you may choose to self-host your Pod.

                            People can even have multiple Pods. They can be hosted by the same Pod Provider or by
                            different Providers or be self-hosted or any combination thereof. The number of Pods someone
                            has, as well as which Solid Server or Servers they use, is effectively transparent to the
                            applications and services that they use. This is because, in the Solid ecosystem, data is
                            linked through one’s Identity and not through the specifics of their Pod. This is true for
                            one’s own data as well as for data that others have shared with them.</p>
